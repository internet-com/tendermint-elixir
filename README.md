## Purpose <a id="chapter-0"></a>

* Write an Elixir Application that uses the Tendermint Core (Blockchain Engine) 

## Goals <a id="chapter-1"></a>

* [X] Install Tendermint Core (BFT Consensus) in Go `tendermint --help`
* [X] Install Tendermint ABCI-CLI `abci-cli --help`
* [X] Create Boilerplate Elixir Tendermint Application
* [X] Load [Merkle Tree Elixir Library](https://github.com/yosriady/merkle_tree) with [Mix](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/mix/) into Elixir Tendermint Application. Merke Tree Erlang Library is used perform Merkle Proof Calculations to verify State-Replication https://github.com/yosriady/merkle_tree#usage
* [X] Load [Tendermint ABCI Server (Erlang)](https://github.com/KrzysiekJ/abci_server) with Mix into Elixir Tendermint Application 
* [X] Run Elixir Tendermint Application (optionally using Interactive Elixir (IEx))
  * [X] Start the Tendermint ABCI Server (Erlang)
  * [X] Stop the Tendermint ABCI Server (Erlang)
* [X] Create Shell Script to generate Tendermint Testnet with four (4) Nodes `bash launch_testnet_nodes.sh`
* [ ] Create Elixir ABCI Application and processes ABCI-CLI (Tendermint Client) and cURL requests to say the `broadcast_tx_commit` endpoint of the Tendermint ABCI (Tendermint's server-side Application BlockChain Interface API) that uses the Tendermint Core, which is a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) Blockchain Engine Middlware that processes a State Transition machine input from any language (i.e. Elixir) and replicates it on many Tendermint Testnet Nodes as output. Successful transactions are included in the Mempool, broadcast to Peers, and eventually committed in a Block with the return value containing `check_tx` and `deliver_tx` properties (each containing `data` and `log` sub-properties) to signify that the transaction was run through the CheckTx and DeliverTx ABCI messages of the TMSP (Simple Messaging Protocol)
* [ ] Implement the Merkle Tree Elixir Library example code https://github.com/yosriady/merkle_tree#usage 
* [ ] Generate Documentation with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc) and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm)
* [ ] Publish on [Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish)

# Experimentation with Merkle Tree Elixir Library (in IEx REPL) <a id="chapter-10"></a>

* Merkle Tree Library
  * [MerkleTree Module Example](https://hexdocs.pm/merkle_tree/MerkleTree.html)
    * Create a Merkle Tree (given a number of string Blocks, and optional Cryptographic Hash Function):
      * Each non-leaf node is labelled with the hash of the labels or values (for leafs) of its child nodes
      * Allows efficent and secure verification of the contents of large data structures
      * Default Hash Function is `:sha256`

# About Tendermint <a id="chapter-13"></a>

* Tendermint

  * Background - https://blockchainhub.net/blog/blog/scaling-ethereum-2/

  * Diagrams
    * Tendermint in a (technical) nutshell - https://github.com/devcorn/hackatom/blob/master/tminfo.pdf

  * TendermintCore (BFT "consensus engine" Protocol that is mostly Asynchronous that uses a Simple State Machine https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html#consensus-overview, and that communicates with an Application via TSP socket protocol that satisfies the ABCI)
    * About
      * Tendermint Core
        * Definition - a general purpose blockchain data structure (transactions batched in blocks where each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, and the blocks form a chain) to replicate your Application on distributed systems (many machines) to provide fault tolerance
          * Secure Replication - Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) since it still works when up to 1/3 of machines fail (from causes including hacking and malicious attacks)
          * Consistent Replication - all non-faulty machines may see same Transaction Log and computes same State
          * Consensus Engine - sharing Blocks and Transactions between Nodes to ensure recorded on all machines in same immutable order (blockchain)
          * Hosts Arbitrary States - may be used as plug-and-play replacement for consensus engines of other blockchain software (i.e. run any programming language implementation of Ethereum as an ABCI application using Tendermint consensus, i.e. Ethermint, Cosmos network)

    * Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus engine
      * Note: Non Proof-of-Work (PoW) system
      * Reference: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm
        * Summary
          * Block Data Structure - https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Block-Structure
            * `Header` - chain info and Last State
              * `ChainId` (string): name of the Blockchain, e.g. "tendermint"
              * `Height` (int): sequential Block Number starting with 1
              * `Time` (time): local time of the Proposer of this Block
              * `LastBlockHash` ([]byte): Block Hash of the Previous Block at `Height - 1`
              * `LastBlockPartsetHeader` (PartSetHeader): Partset Header of the Previous Block
              * `StateHash` ([]byte): State Hash of the State after processing this Block
                * `StateHash` is a hash derived from a encoding the State's Fields (i.e. `BondedValidators`, `UnbondingValidators`, `Accounts`, `ValidatorInfos`, and `NameRegistry`), using a [Simple Tree (Binary Tree)](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Merkle-Trees#simple-tree-with-dictionaries) to merkelise a dictionary list of KV Pair structs.
                * `StateHash` is recursively included in the block `Header` and indirectly into the `BlockHash`

            * `Data` - Transactions of the Block that are any sequence of Bytes comprising:
              * `Txs` ([]`Tx`): list of Transactions. 
              Note: [ABCI Applications](https://github.com/tendermint/abci) (previuosly known as TMSP) may Accept or Reject a Tx
            * `LastCommit` - Comprises `Precommit` Signatures of the Previous Block 
              * `Precommits` ([]`Vote`): confirms that Consensus Decided for the Last Block was performed by over 2/3 (i.e. +2/3) of valid Voting Participants
                * `Vote`
                  * `Height` (int): Block Height being Decided on
                  * `Round` (int): Consensus Round number (starting with 0)
                  * `Type` (byte): Vote Type, either:
                    * `Prevote` or `Precommit` - [Vote Type](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Block-Structure#vote) to Broadcast
                      i.e. `"type": 2`
                    * Note: Proof-of-Lock-Change (PoLC) is the Set of +2/3 `Prevote`'s for a Block, or `<nil>` at Node `(H, R)`
                  * `BlockHash` ([]byte): 
                    * Block Hash of a valid Block, or nil.
                    * Blockhash is a hash derived from a encoding the Block Header fields using a [Simple Tree (Binary Tree)](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Merkle-Trees#simple-tree-with-dictionaries) to merkelise a dictionary list of KV Pair structs
                  * `BlockPartsetHeader` (PartSetHeader):
                    * PartSet Header, or x0000 if Block Hash is nil
                    * PartSet (inspired by LibSwift project) is used to propagate a Large File over a Gossip Protocol Network (i.e. multicast a message to all nodes in a network, where each node only sends the message to a few of the nodes)
                    * PartSet splits a Byteslice of Data (a Part) into a Transmission Parts List. Compute the Merke Root Hash of the Transmission Parts List. Verify that a Part is legitimately a Part of the Data by using the Merkle Root Hash of the Transmission Parts List prior to Forwarding the Part to other Peers (even before other Parts are known)  
                      i.e. `{ "hash": "XYZ", "total": 123 }`
                    * Example code: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Block-Structure#commit
                  * `Signature` (Signature): `Signature` field of Vote's Transaction
                    * `sign-bytes`: JSON stringified (ordered) encoding (excluding the `Signature`) of Vote's Transaction
                      i.e. Example Precommit Vote:
                      `{ "chain_id": "tendermint","vote": { ... } }`

          * Consensus Process (State Machine) - https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html#consensus-overview 
            * Deciding Next Block (at each Block Height `H`)
              * Rounds (Round-based Protocol) - each Round has a State Machine `RoundStep` representation (aka "Step") comprising Optimally 3x Steps + 2x Special Steps:
                * Round (sequence)
                  * Step 1: `Propose (H, R)` 
                    * Prerequisite, either:
                      * `CommitTime` + `timeoutCommit` (after `NewHeight` committed) OR
                      * `timeoutPrecommit`
                    * Start:
                      * Proposer (designated) proposes a Block at `(H, R)`
                    * End: 
                      * After `timeoutProposer` -> Step 2
                      * After `PoLC Round` receipt of Proposal Block and all Prevotes -> Step 2
                      * After "Common Exit Conditions"
                        * Question Raised - How does this make sense when all the common exit conditions occur after "Step 1"
                          * https://matrix.to/#/!vIMgGaMqkLIWPCZvPF:matrix.org/$15167017365754249pwRYF:matrix.org
                  * Step 2: `Prevote (H, R)`
                    * Start:
                      * Validators broadcast their Prevote Vote
                    * Situations:
                      * Unlocking happens when Validators that have been Locked on a Block since `LastLockRound`
                      who also have a `PoLC` for something else at `PoLC-Round` where `LastLockRound < PoLC-Round < R`
                      * Prevote for a Block happens when a Validator is still Locked on a Block
                      * Prevote for a Proposed Block from `Propose (H, R)` happens when it is Valid
                      * Prevote of `<nil>` happens for a Proposed Block that is Invalid or received late
                    * End:
                      * After +2/3 Prevotes for a specific Block or `<nil>` -> Step 3
                      * After `timeoutPrevote` after receiving any +2/3 Prevotes -> Step 3
                      * After "Common Exit Conditions"
                  * Step 3: `Precommit (H, R)` after +2/3 Precommits for Block found
                    * Start:
                      * Validators broadcast their Precommit Vote
                    * Situation:
                      * Re-Locks / Changes Lock and Precommits Block `B` and Sets `LastLockRound = R` when Validator has PoLC `(H, R)` for specific Block `B`
                      * Unlocks and Precommits `<nil>` (i.e. obtained +2/3 Prevotes and waited but did not see PoLC for the Round) when Validator has PoLC at `(H, R)` for `<nil>`
                      * Lock remains and Precommits `<nil>` otherwise
                    * End:
                      * After +2/3 Precommits for `<nil>` -> Step 1 `Propose (H, R + 1)`
                      * After `timeoutPrecommit` after receiving any +2/3 Precommits -> Step 1 `Propose (H, R + 1)`
                      * After "Common Exit Conditions"
                * Special Step A: `Commit (H)` by:
                  * Setting `CommitTime = now`
                  * Waiting to receive Block and then Stage, Save, and Commit the Block -> Step B `NewHeight (H + 1)`
                * Special Step B: `NewHeight (H)`
                  * Move `Precommits` to `LastCommit`
                  * Increment Block Height
                  * Set `StartTime = CommitTime + timeoutCommit`
                  * Wait until `StartTime` to receive straggling commits -> Step 1 `Propose (H, 0)`
                    i.e. `NewHeight -> (Propose -> Prevote -> Precommit) + -> Commit -> NewHeight ->`
                * Note: See Diagram: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm
              * Note: Multiple Rounds may be required to due to:
                * Problems
                  * Proposer (designated) was not online
                  * Proposer (designated) had proposed an Invalid Block
                  * Proposer (designated) had proposed a Valid Block that did not propogate in time
                  * Proposer (designated) had proposed a Valid Block but +2/3 of its Prevotes were not received in time (i.e. at least 1x Validator may have voted `<nil>` or performed a malicious votes) so there were Insufficient Validator Nodes when the Precommit step was reached
                  * Proposer (designated) had proposed a Valid Block and +2/3 of its Prevotes were received for sufficent nodes, but +2/3 of the Precommits for the Proposed Block were not received for sufficient Validator nodes.
                * Solutions
                  * Subsequent Round and Proposer (designated)
                  * Increasing Round parameters (i.e. Timeout) for successive rounds

          * Proposal 
            * Signed & Published by Proposer (designated) at each Round
            * Proposal at Node `(H, R)` comprises:
              * Block
              * Optional PoLC Round (which is less than `R`), included if Proposer is aware of one, and provides a hint to the network to allow "unlocking" of Nodes when safe to ensure "Proof of Liveness"

          * Proposer (NOT Validators)
            * Selected in proportion to their Voting Power (using round robin selection algorithm)
            * Reference: [Code](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/develop/types/validator_set.go#L49)

          * Nodes - optionally connected in the network, are at a given:
            * Height `H` - Block Height being decided upon
            * Round `R` - Consensus Round number (starting from 0)
            * Step `S`
              * i.e. `(H, R, S)`
          
          * Peers - are Nodes that are directly connected to a Node

          * `Channel` (Throttled information)
            * `Connection` - between 2x Nodes

          * Epidemic Gossip Protocol - implemented by some Channels to update Peers on latest State of Consensus 
            * Nodes use PartSet algorithm (LibSwift inspired) to gossip/broadcast Parts (split Data) across the network for the current Round decision for a Proposed Block by a Proposer
            * Nodes gossip Prevote/Precommit Votes to enable Other Nodes to progress forward
              i.e. Node A (ahead of Node B) may send Node B Prevotes/Precommits for Node B's current/future Round
            * Nodes gossip Prevotes for Proposed Proof-of-Lock-Change (PoLC) Round (i.e. requires Set of +2/3 `Prevote`'s for a Block, or `<nil>` at Node `(H, R)`
            * Nodes gossip Block Commits for Older Blocks to Other Nodes that are lagging with a lower Blockchain Height
            * Nodes gossip `HasVote` messages opportunistically to hint to Peers what Votes they have
            * Nodes broadcast to all Peers their current State

          * Gossip Protocol Participants are "Validators"
            * Validators
              * Validators take turns as Proposer (delegate) Blocks containing Transactions and Voting on Blocks to be Committed on-chain at Block Height
              * Validators Vote to move to Next Round after waiting a Timeout interval (the only Synchronous aspect of the Protocol) to receive a complete Proposal Block from the Proposer 
              * Validators only progress after hearing from 2/3+ of the Validator Set

            * Blocks
              * Failure of a Block Commit causes the Protocol to move to the Next Round with a New Validator as Proposer (delegate) to propose the Next Block Height
              * Tendermint uses same mechanism for Block Commits as it does for Skipping to Next Round
              * Tendermint guarantees Safety without Validators ever committing a Block Commit that conflicts at the same Block Height on the assumption that 1/3- of Validators are BFT by using "Locking" rules that modulate the paths that may be followed in the Consensus Flow Diagram

            * Block Commit Failure
              * Causes
                * Proposer (delegate) may be Offline
                * Network may be slow
              * Solutions
                * Skip a Validator
            
            * Voting Stages required for Block Commit
              * Prevote 
                * Block Committed when 2/3+ of Validators Precommit for the same Block in the same Round.
                * "Polka" occurs when 2/3+ of Validators Prevote for the same Block
              * Precommit
                * Precommitted Blocks by a Validator are "Locked" on the Block and then must Prevote for the Block it is "Locked" on
                * Validators may only "Unlock" and Precommit for a New Block if there is a "Polka" for the New Block in a later Round
                * Precommits must be justified by a "Polka" in the same Round

            * Nodes
              * Non-Active Validators 
                * No Validator Private Key
                * Relays to Peers any Consensus Process information (i.e. meta-data, Proposals, Blocks, and Votes)
                * State (Current `H`, `R`, `S`)
                * Enable other Nodes to progress forward
              * Active Validator (aka "Validator-Node")
                * Validator Private Keys
                * Signs Votes
                * State (Current `H`, `R`, `S`)
                * Enable other Nodes to progress forward

            * Stake
              * Validator "Weight" varies in the Consensys Protocol of some systems
                * Voting Power Proportion may not be uniformly distributed across individual Validators 
              * Tendermint allows for creation of Proof-of-Stake systems through definition of a native Currency that denominates Voting Power. Cosmos Network is designed using this PoS mechanism across an array of cryptocurrencies implemented as ABCI Applications
                * Validators "bond" their Voting Power Currency holdings in a security deposit that may be destroyed if found to misbehave in the Consensys Protocol, which quantifies an economic security element whereby the Cost of Violating the assumption that 2/3- of Voting Power is Byzantine 

          * Proofs

            * Proof of Safety
              * Assuming -1/3 (less than 1/3) of Validators voting power are Byzantine
              * Validators may commit Block `B` at Round `R` after observing +2/3 (over 2/3) of Precommits at Round `R`
              * Unlikely for 1/3+ (over 1/3) of Honest Nodes Locked at Round `R' > R` to remain so until they observe PoLC at `R' > R`
              * -2/3 (less than 2/3) are available to Vote for anything other than Block `B`
              since 1/3+ (over 1/3) are Locked and Honest Nodes
              * CONFUSING?
            
            * Proof of Liveness
              * Assuming 1/3+ (over 1/3) of Validators are Locked on 2x different Blocks from different Rounds
              then a Proposer's `PoLC-Round` will Unlock Nodes that were Locked in previous Rounds
              * Proposer (designated) will become aware of a PoLC in a subsequent Round 
              * `timeoutProposalR` increments with Round `R` whilst Proposal size is capped, so network eventually is able to fully gossip the whole Proposal (both Block and PoLC)

            * TODO
              * Proof of Fork Accountability - https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm#proof-of-fork-accountability
              * Alternative Algorithm - https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm#alternative-algorithm
              * Censorship Attacks - https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/wiki/Byzantine-Consensus-Algorithm#censorship-attacks

    * Benefits:
      * Speed
        * Tendermint blocks can commit to finality in the order of 1 second
        * TendermintCore can handle transaction volume at the rate of 10,000 transactions per second for 250 byte transactions.
      * Security
        * Tendermint consensus is optimally BFT with accountability since liability may be determined when the blockchain forks
      * Scalability
        * Tendermint may be used for Sharding since it allows running parallel blockchains in parallel without the speed or security of each chain diminishing (unlike with PoW)  
        * Tendermint algorithm can scale to hundreds or thousands of validators (depending on desired block times), and improves over time with advances in bandwidth and CPU capacity.

  * Tendermint Generic Application BlockChain "Interface" (ABCI) is an API between Application Process and Consensus Process. ABCI has a Tendermint Socket Protocol (TSP aka Teaspoon) Implementation:
    * Run in separate Unix processes.
    * De-coupling (abstracting away) the Application State Details of a particular blockchain Application (using a socket protocol) from the Tendermint Core (consensus engine and P2P layers) to avoid a "monolithic" blockchain "stack" design so not limited to just using language of the blockchain stack that compile down to say the Turing-complete bytecode of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) (i.e. Serpent, Solidity)
    * Allows BFT replication of applications with Transactions processed in any programming language
    * Security guarantees
    * ABCI has 3x Primary Message Types (delivered from Tendermint Core to the ABCI, then ABCI replies with response messages)
      * DeliverTx Message
        * Transactions on the blockchain are delivered with it
        * Validation of Transactions received with the DeliverTx message must be validated by the Application against the current State, Application Protocol, and Transaction's Cryptographic Credentials
        * Valid Transactions update the Application State (i.e binding a value in a KV Store or updating the UTXO DB)
      * CheckTx Message
        * Only for Validating Transactions
        * Validates Transaction using Tendermint Core's Mempool
        * Only Relays Valid Transactions to Peers
        * Invalid Transactions may be caused if a Capabilities Based System is used but they have not renewed their capabilities with each Transaction, or CheckTx in an Application may return an error if a sequence number in a Transaction was not incremented
      * Commit Message
        * Computes the Cryptographic Commitment to the current Application State to be inserted into Next Block Header
        * Inconsistencies and errors in updating State appear as Blockchain Forks 
        * Secure Lightweight Client development is simplified since Merkle-Hash Proofs may be Verified against the Block Hash, which is Signed by a Quorum
    * Applications may have Multiple ABCI Socket Connections (3x created by Tendermint Core), including (see Diagram in https://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html#intro-to-abci):
      * Connection 1: Validates Transactions when broadcasting in the Mempool
      * Connection 2: Consensus Engine to run Block Proposals
      * Connection 3: Querying the Application State

    * Application Logic Deterministic
      * Transaction processing on blockchain must be Deterministic so Consensus is reached among Tendermint Core replica Nodes
      * Blockchain Developers should avoid Non-Determinism by using Linters and Static Analysers:
        * Avoid Random Number Generators without Deterministic Seeding
        * Avoid Race Conditions on threads
        * Avoid use of System Clock 
        * Avoid Uninitialised Memory (in Unsafe languages like C or C++)
        * Avoid Floating Point Arithmetic
        * Avoid Random Language Features 

  * Communication between TendermintCore and Tendermint Applications
    * TMSP (Simple Messaging Protocol)
